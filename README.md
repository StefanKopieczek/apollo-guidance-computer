Apollo Guidance Computer
========================

What is this?
-------------

This project is a work-in-progress emulator for the AGC hardware.
At present, the project is not useable, but I live in hope of eventually getting it working!


How do I run it?
----------------

You don't -- I'm still in the early phases of development.
