The choice of GPL v3 for this project reflects the significant debt owed to the efforts
of the Virtual AGC Project (https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/). Although no source from
Virtual AGC is used in my project, I have at times referred to the yaAGC documentation
and source code to verify the correctness of this implementation. Since the yaAGC source
is licensed under "GPL 2.0 or greater" it seemed best for the avoidance of potential license conflicts to use the GPL here also.

My sincere thanks to Ron Burkey and the other collaborators on the VirtualAGC project for
their incredible work.
